# DIY_SPO2
DIY SpO‚ÇÇ and Heart Rate Monitor

This project is a DIY pulse oximeter built around the MAX30102 sensor, Arduino Nano, and an SSD1306 OLED display.
It measures blood oxygen saturation (SpO‚ÇÇ) and heart rate (BPM) in real-time.

The repository includes:

Firmware (Arduino code)

Hardware (KiCad schematic & PCB)

Documentation (wiring diagrams, PCB images, BOM, etc.)

üöÄ Features

Reads SpO‚ÇÇ (%) and heart rate (BPM) using the MAX30102 sensor

Real-time display on 0.96" SSD1306 OLED screen

Compact PCB design (KiCad project + Gerbers included)

Open-source and customizable

üõ† Components Used

Arduino Nano (ATmega328P)

MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter & Heart Rate Sensor

SSD1306 OLED Display (128x64, I2C)

Misc: Resistors, capacitors, push buttons, connectors
